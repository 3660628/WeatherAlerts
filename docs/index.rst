About WeatherAlerts
*********************

This python module started as part of another project of mine. But since this is more useful as a standalone module, I've decided to move it to it's own project and open source it. As this is a alpha/beta release aspects of the project will change, and probably pretty often. Check back here for updates, if you install using pip, you can run ``pip install -U weatheralerts`` to get the latest version. (I've been releasing on average a minor release per week, and several point releases per week.)

This code is provided under GPLv3 (see LICENSE.txt). If you do make improvements, please contribute back to this project. I certainly welcome new features, improvments and of course bug fixes. You can submit a git pull request or email me: zeb@zebpalmer.com

This project lives at `github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts <http://github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts>`_

Goals
======
Use cases that I am in considering in the development of WeatherAlerts.

- Simple command line tool for checking active, local alerts.
- Packaged module to call from other programs
- Daemon to run and notify alerts as they come in
- Nagios monitoring pluging
- A web service that given various paramaters will return json or raw text summaries of the requested data.
- Would love to see someone a KDE plasmoid/widget that would pop up alerts
