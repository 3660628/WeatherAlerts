PROJECT STATUS & TODO
===================
This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess. It started in my early days of python. But as I have time,
I'm rewriting it.

Python 2/3 Support
-----------------
Official releases of this module support recent versions of both 2.x and 3.x.
The package is currently tested in python 2.7 and 3.2, it should work work with
python 2.6, but will not work with previous versions. Development is currently
done in python 2.7 and is ported to 3 upon install via 2to3.
