Current Relase:
===================
The current release of WeatherAlerts is 0.4.9 and is avilible on pypi.
The next version, 5.x, will not be backwards compatible with the 4.x
as there are significant improvements. Please test any scripts that rely
on WeatherAlerts before upgrading.


PROJECT STATUS & TODO
===================
This module is a mess (but mostly a functional mess) as
it started in my early days of python... as I have time I'm rewriting it. I'm
dropping support for python 3 on the rewrite branch since 90% of what I code
in is 2.7. I will certainly port it back to 3 before releasing the new
version to pypi.

This project lives at `github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts <http://github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts>`_

Install
---------

Python 2/3 Support
-----------------
Official releases of this module support recent versions of both 2.x and 3.x.
The package is currently tested in python 2.7 and 3.2, it should work work with
python 2.6, but will not work with previous versions. Development is currently
done in python 2.7 and is ported to 3 upon install.
