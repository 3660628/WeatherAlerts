PROJECT STATUS
===================
This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess. This code started in my early days of python. But as I have time,
I'm rewriting it, 0.5.x is much improved.

CURRENT BUILD STATUS:

As of 0.5.x this package has 100% test coverage, every commit is built and tested in both python 2 and python 3.
