Python 2 Support
""""""""""""""""
The master branch and all releases of this program are written for Python 3.x. Shortly after any released version, I will update the python2.x branch, you can download and use it, but there will be no supported releases from it. 



Goals
""""""
Use cases that I am moving to support first. 

- Command line usage 
- Packaged module to call from other programs 
- Nagios monitoring script 
- A web service that given various paramaters will return json or raw text summaries of the requested data.
 
*If you have another use case, feel free to submit a request and jump in to help if you can.*
