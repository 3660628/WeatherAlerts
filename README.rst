===================
The current release of WeatherAlerts is 0.4.9 and is on pypi.

on WeatherAlerts before upgrading.


Development Release:
=======================
You can install the current development release of WeatherAlerts by running

``pip install https://github.com/zebpalmer/WeatherAlerts/tarball/0.5.0a2``


PROJECT STATUS
===================
This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess. This code started in my early days of python. But as I have time,
I'm rewriting it, 0.5.x is much improved. 

As of 0.5.0a2, the module has 100% test coverage. Each commit is built and tested in both python 2 and python 3.
