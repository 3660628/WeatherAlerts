PROJECT STATUS & TODO
===================
This module is a mess, a functional mess, but still a mess. It started in my early days of python. But as I have time,
I'm rewriting it, 0.5.x is much improved.

As of 0.5.0a2, the module has 100% test coverage. Each commit is built and tested in both python 2 and python 3.

python 2.6, but will not work with previous versions. Development is currently
